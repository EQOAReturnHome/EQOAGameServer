In his festering jealousy, Solusek Ro cursed the race of elves by destroying our city Takish'Hiz in the Elddar Forest. He prevented the rain from ever reaching the forest, and thus caused years of drought. It is known as the Great Burning. Those of us that survived and escaped made our way here. Now it is our duty protect the seeds of Elddar, and deliver them to safety in the lands across the ocean in the east."
