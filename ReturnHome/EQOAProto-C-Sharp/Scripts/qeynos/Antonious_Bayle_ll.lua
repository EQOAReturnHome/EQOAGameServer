It is by his sheer willpower and leadership that we have transformed this realm, and made the world better for all civilized beings. No heretics, rebels or minions of darkness shall spoil our victory. Perhaps I will draw up an order to declare the new name of this realm to be "Antonica" after my father, as I intend on defending his legacy with every fiber of my being."
